
<!-- My PortFolio Website -->
This project is a portfolio website that shows the skills, achievements and accomplishments that I have achieved. This will show potential employers to see my potential and skills that I can be good in and see whether I am suited for the job.

<!-- Design Process -->
As a student, I want to attract potential employers, so that I can impress them and make them want to employ me. This project showcases my experiences that I have and of course my HTML, CSS and Javascript abilities.

<!-- Features -->
There are a few main features that I would like to highlight in this website 
Firstly, there is a fixed responsive navigation bar where when reduced in size, will turn into a burger icon that can be opened to navigate throughout the website.

Secondly, I have added some hover animations so as to make the website more lively. They fade from white to a crimson colour.

Thirdly, I have added a gallery so as to put in the photos into one section without taking out too much space.

Forthly, there is a contact form where potential employers can reach out to me. These fields are required and I have also added a text that can be seen once the message has been sent.

Features Left to Implement:
In the future, I would like to add more javascript animations and buttons to redirect you to other pages where you can see more of the projects that I have done.

<!-- Testing -->
Contact form:
    Go to the "Contact Us" page
    Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
