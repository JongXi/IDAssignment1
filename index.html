              I redesigned the Spotify logo using Adobe Illustrator as there are a few problems with it. Firstly, it does not immediately tell me that this logo is representing music. Secondly, the waves on the logo are tilted to the right side. This has been acknowledged by Spotify however they refuse to change it. Thirdly, the logo looks bland and commonly seen everywhere. The three waves can be seen in other places like WiFi.
